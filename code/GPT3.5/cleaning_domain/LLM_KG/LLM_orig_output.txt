COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

To water the plants, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the water and the plant. If the plant is not placed in a receptacle, I will put it in a pot or a vase. I will pick up the watering can and fill it with water. Then, I will pour the water from the watering can onto the soil around the plant. The plants are watered!
