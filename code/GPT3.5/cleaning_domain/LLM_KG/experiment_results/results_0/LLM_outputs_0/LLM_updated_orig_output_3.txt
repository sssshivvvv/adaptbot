I apologize for the mistake. Here's the updated COT and action sequence:

COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

To clean the bedroom floor, I will need a mop cloth. Since the provided minimum required item is "mop_cloth", I will pick up the mop cloth from the wardrobe. Then, I will put it on the bedroom floor and mop the floor using the mop cloth. The bedroom floor is now cleaned!

pick_up_obj("mop_cloth", "wardrobe") # Picking up the mop cloth from the wardrobe
put_down_obj("mop_cloth", "bedroom_floor") # Putting down the mop cloth onto the bedroom floor
mop("bedroom_floor", "updated_onto.ttl") # Mopping the bedroom floor

Note: Please ensure that the "mop_cloth" is available in the wardrobe before performing the actions.
