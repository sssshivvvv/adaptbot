I apologize for the mistake. Here is the updated COT and action sequence to clean the window using the mop cloth:

COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

To clean the window, I will first fetch the items I need. I will pick up the mop cloth from the rack and move to the window. I will then use the mop cloth to clean the window by wiping it. Once the window is clean, I will put down the mop cloth on the rack.

pick_up_tool("mop_cloth", "initial_onto.ttl")  # picking up the mop cloth from the rack
move("mop_cloth", "dining_table")  # moving to the dining table
move("mop_cloth", "window")  # moving to the window
clean("window", "updated_onto.ttl")  # cleaning the window with the mop cloth
put_down_tool("mop_cloth", "rack")  # putting down the mop cloth on the rack
