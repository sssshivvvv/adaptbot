My apologies for the mistake.

COT:

To dust the TV, I will first fetch the item I need, which is the mop cloth. Then, I will pick up the mop cloth and use it to clean the TV. Once the TV is dust-free, I will put down the mop cloth.

ACTION SEQUENCE:

pick_up_obj("mop_cloth", "updated_onto.ttl")  # picking up the mop cloth
pick_up_tool("mop_cloth", "updated_onto.ttl")  # picking up the mop cloth
mop("TV", "updated_onto.ttl")  # using the mop cloth to dust the TV
put_down_tool("mop_cloth", "countertop")  # putting down the mop cloth
