Apologies for the mistake. Here is the revised COT and action sequence to dust the TV using the mop cloth.

COT:

To dust the TV, I will first check if the TV is present in the environment. If the TV is present, I will fetch the mop cloth. Then, I will pick up the mop cloth, clean the TV using it, and finally put down the mop cloth.

ACTION SEQUENCE:

move("TV", "living_room_floor")  # moving to the living room where the TV is located
pick_up_obj("mop_cloth", "updated_onto.ttl")  # picking up the mop cloth
clean("TV", "updated_onto.ttl")  # using the mop cloth to dust the TV
put_down_obj("mop_cloth", "countertop")  # putting down the mop cloth

Please note that the location "living_room_floor" is assumed as the location of the TV. We need to specify the actual location of the TV in the environment ontology.
