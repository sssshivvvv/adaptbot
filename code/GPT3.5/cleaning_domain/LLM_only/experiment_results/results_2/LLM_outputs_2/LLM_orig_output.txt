COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

To wash the clothes, I will first gather the items I need. I will bring the clothes, detergent, and the washing machine. If the washing machine is not empty, I will empty it first. I will put the clothes into the washing machine and add the detergent. After closing the washing machine, I will start the washing cycle. I will wait for the washing cycle to complete. Once the cycle finishes, I will open the washing machine and take out the clothes. The clothes are now clean!
