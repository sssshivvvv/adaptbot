COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

To wash the dishes, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the plate and the bowl. If the plate is not washed, I will clean it first. If the bowl is not washed, I will clean it first. I will then put the plate and the bowl into the sink. I will turn on the water and pour water into the sink. I will then pick up the plate and the bowl one by one, and scrub them using a sponge. After scrubbing, I will rinse them under the running water. Once they are clean, I will put them on the rack to dry. The dishes are now washed!
