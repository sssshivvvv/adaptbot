COT & ACTION SEQUENCE: 

1. Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:

To prepare a basic cake, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the bowl, all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla extract, and cake pan.

put_down_rec("bowl", "countertop") #putting down the bowl on the countertop
pick_up_obj("all_purpose_flour", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the all-purpose flour
put_down_obj("all_purpose_flour", "countertop") #putting down the all-purpose flour on the countertop
pick_up_obj("baking_powder", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the baking powder
put_down_obj("baking_powder", "countertop") #putting down the baking powder on the countertop
pick_up_obj("sugar", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the sugar

To prepare the cake batter, I will mix the dry ingredients, add the wet ingredients, and then mix everything together in the bowl.

mix_contents("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") #mixing the dry ingredients in the bowl

pick_up_obj("vanilla_extract", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the vanilla extract
put_down_obj("vanilla_extract", "bowl") #putting the vanilla extract into the bowl
pick_up_obj("butter", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the butter
put_down_obj("butter", "bowl") #putting the butter into the bowl
mix_contents("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") #mixing all the ingredients together in the bowl

3. Plating and serving:

I will pour the cake batter into the cake pan and then bake it in the oven.
