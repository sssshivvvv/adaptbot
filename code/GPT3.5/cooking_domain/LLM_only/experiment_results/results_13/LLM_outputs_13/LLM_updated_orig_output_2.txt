                           COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

1. Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:
To prepare the egg sandwich, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the bread, egg, and butter. If the bread is not already on the countertop, I will put it there.

pick_up_obj("bread", "updated_onto.ttl")  # picking up the bread
put_down_obj("bread", "countertop")  # putting down the bread on the countertop if it is not already there
pick_up_obj("egg", "updated_onto.ttl")  # picking up the egg
put_down_obj("egg", "countertop")  # putting down the egg on the countertop
pick_up_obj("butter", "updated_onto.ttl")  # picking up the butter
put_down_obj("butter", "countertop")  # putting down the butter on the countertop

2. Cooking process:
To prepare the egg sandwich, I will first slice the bread and fry the egg using the butter.

slice("bread", "knife", "updated_onto.ttl")  # slicing the bread
fry("egg", "pan")  # frying the egg in the pan with butter

3. Plating and serving:
I will put the fried egg between two slices of bread to make the sandwich.

pick_up_obj("sliced_bread", "updated_onto.ttl")  # picking up the sliced bread
put_down_obj("sliced_bread", "countertop")  # putting down the sliced bread on the countertop
pick_up_obj("fried_egg", "updated_onto.ttl")  # picking up the fried egg
put_down_obj("fried_egg", "sliced_bread")  # putting down the fried egg on the bread slice
pick_up_obj("sliced_bread", "updated_onto.ttl")  # picking up the sliced bread
put_down_obj("sliced_bread", "fried_egg")  # putting down the sliced bread on top of the fried egg
pick_up_obj("sandwich", "updated_onto.ttl")  # picking up the completed sandwich
put_down_obj("sandwich", "serving_plate")  # putting down the completed sandwich on the serving plate
