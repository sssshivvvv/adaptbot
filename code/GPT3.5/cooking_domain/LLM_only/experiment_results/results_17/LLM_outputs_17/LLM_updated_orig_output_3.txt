My apologies for the oversight. Here is the corrected COT and action sequence to prepare onion soup using the minimum ingredients provided (onion, water, and salt):

COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

1. Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:

To prepare the onion soup, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the pan, onion, water, and salt. If any of the ingredients are not present, I will abort the cooking process.

pick_up_obj("onion", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the onion
put_down_obj("onion", "countertop") # putting down the onion on the countertop
pick_up_obj("water", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the water
put_down_obj("water", "countertop") # putting down the water on the countertop

2. Cooking process:

To prepare the onion soup, I will slice the onion, boil it in water with salt, and mix the contents.

slice("onion", "knife", "updated_onto.ttl") # slicing the onion
put_down_obj("onion", "cutting_board") # putting down the sliced onion on the cutting board
boil("water", "updated_onto.ttl") # boiling the water with salt
pick_up_tool("spoon", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the spoon
stir_contents("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # stirring the contents in the pan

3. Plating and serving:

Once the onion soup is ready, I will serve it and the dish will be ready to enjoy!

pick_up_rec("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the bowl
put_down_rec("bowl", "countertop") # putting down the bowl on the countertop
pour_contents("pan", "bowl") # pouring the onion soup from the pan into the bowl

Please make sure to follow the sequence and perform the actions accordingly.
