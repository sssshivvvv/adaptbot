2. Cooking process:

To prepare the French Toast Sandwich, I will follow these steps:
- Beat the egg with milk to make a batter.
- Heat the pan with oil.
- Dip the bread slices in the batter and place them in the pan to toast.
- Flip the bread slices to toast both sides.
- Place the ham and cheese on one slice of bread.
- Place the other slice of bread on top to form a sandwich.
- Heat the sandwich in the pan until the cheese melts.

pick_up_obj("egg", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the egg
put_down_rec("egg", "pan") #putting the egg into the pan
pick_up_obj("milk", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the milk
put_down_rec("milk", "pan") #putting the milk into the pan
mix_contents("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") #mixing the contents of the pan
pick_up_obj("bread", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the bread

wait(2) #waiting for the bread to toast
flip_contents("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") #flipping the bread slices in the pan
wait(1) #waiting for the bread to toast on the other side
pick_up_obj("ham", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the ham
put_down_rec("ham", "pan") #putting the ham into the pan
pick_up_obj("cheese", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the cheese
put_down_rec("cheese", "pan") #putting the cheese into the pan

3. Plating and serving:

To finalize the French Toast Sandwich, I will serve it on a plate.

put_down_obj("bread", "plate") #putting the bread onto the plate

The French Toast Sandwich is now ready to be served!
