                                    COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

1. Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:

To prepare the egg omelette, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the pan, egg, oil, and salt from the refrigerator. If the pan is not cleaned, I will clean it first.

pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the pan
put_down_rec("pan", "countertop") #putting down the pan on the countertop
pick_up_tool("spatula", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the spatula
put_down_tool("spatula", "pan") #putting the spatula into the pan

pick_up_obj("egg", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the egg from the refrigerator
put_down_obj("egg", "countertop") #putting down the egg on the countertop

pick_up_obj("oil", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the oil from the refrigerator
put_down_obj("oil", "countertop") #putting down the oil on the countertop

pick_up_obj("salt", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the salt from the refrigerator
put_down_obj("salt", "countertop") #putting down the salt on the countertop

2. Cooking process:

To prepare the egg omelette, I will heat the pan with oil, crack the egg into the pan, add salt, and cook it.

switch("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") #turning on the stove
pour_contents("oil", "pan") #pouring the oil into the pan
slice("egg", "knife", "pan") #cracking the egg into the pan
pour_contents("salt", "pan") #adding salt to the pan
stir_contents("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") #stirring the contents in the pan

3. Plating and serving:

I will cook the egg omelette until it is done and then transfer it to a plate. The egg omelette is ready to be served!

wait(300) #waiting for the egg omelette to cook
pick_up_rec("plate", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the plate
put_down_rec("plate", "countertop") #putting down the plate on the countertop
pick_up_tool("spatula", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the spatula
put_down_tool("spatula", "pan") #using the spatula to transfer the cooked egg omelette onto the plate
