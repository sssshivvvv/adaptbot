COT & ACTION SEQUENCE: 

1. Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:

To prepare the fruit salad, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the bowl, apple, and mango. If the bowl is not cleaned, I will clean it first.

clean("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") #cleaning the bowl
pick_up_rec("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the bowl
put_down_rec("bowl", "countertop") #putting down the bowl on the countertop
pick_up_obj("apple", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the apple
put_down_obj("apple", "countertop") #putting down the apple on the countertop
pick_up_obj("mango", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the mango
put_down_obj("mango", "countertop") #putting down the mango on the countertop

2. Cooking process: 

Since fruit salad does not require any cooking, I will proceed to the next step.

3. Plating and serving:

I will put the diced apple and mango into the bowl. The fruit salad is ready!

pick_up_obj("apple", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the apple
put_down_obj("apple", "bowl") #putting the diced apple into the bowl
pick_up_obj("mango", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the mango
put_down_obj("mango", "bowl") #putting the diced mango into the bowl
