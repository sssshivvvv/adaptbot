I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct the action sequence to adhere strictly to the provided tools, receptacles, and actions using all the ingredients given.

### Chain of Thought (COT) & Action Sequence:

1. **Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:**

To prepare mashed potatoes, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the potato, butter, and salt. Additionally, I will bring the tools needed: a pot for boiling the potatoes, a bowl for mashing, and a spoon for mixing. If any of the required receptacles are not clean, I will clean them first.

```plaintext
pick_up_obj("potato", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the potato
put_down_obj("potato", "countertop") #putting down the potato on the countertop

pick_up_obj("butter", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the butter
put_down_obj("butter", "countertop") #putting down the butter on the countertop

pick_up_obj("salt", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the salt
put_down_obj("salt", "countertop") #putting down the salt on the countertop

pick_up_rec("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the bowl
put_down_rec("bowl", "countertop") #putting down the bowl on the countertop

pick_up_tool("spoon", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the spoon
put_down_tool("spoon", "countertop") #putting down the spoon on the countertop
```

2. **Cooking process:**

To prepare mashed potatoes, I need to boil the potatoes first. After boiling, I will mash them with butter and salt in a bowl.

```plaintext
boil("potato", "updated_onto.ttl") #boiling the potato 
```

3. **Plating and serving:**

I will transfer the boiled potato to a bowl and mix it with butter and salt using a spoon. The mashed potatoes will then be ready to serve.

```plaintext
pick_up_obj("potato", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the boiled potato
put_down_obj("potato", "bowl") #putting down the boiled potato in the bowl

pick_up_obj("butter", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the butter
put_down_obj("butter", "bowl") #putting down the butter in the bowl

pick_up_obj("salt", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the salt
put_down_obj("salt", "bowl") #putting down the salt in the bowl

stir_contents("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") #mixing the contents of the bowl with the spoon
```

This action sequence should now comply with the given environment constraints and use the ingredients provided by the user.
