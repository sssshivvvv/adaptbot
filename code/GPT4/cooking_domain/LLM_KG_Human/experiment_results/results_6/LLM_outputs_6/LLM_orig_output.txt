Certainly! Below is the COT and action sequence for preparing potato fries using the provided ingredients: ['oil', 'potato', 'salt'].

### Chain of Thought (COT):

#### 1. Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:

To prepare potato fries, I will first gather the necessary items. I need to get the potato, salt, oil, spatula, knife, and pan. If the pan is not cleaned, I will clean it first.

#### 2. Cooking process:

For the cooking process, I will need to slice the potato using the knife. Then, I will pour oil into the pan and heat it up. After that, I'll add the sliced potatoes into the pan and fry them while occasionally stirring with the spatula.

#### 3. Plating and serving:

Once the potatoes are fried, I will add salt and then place the fried potatoes onto a plate.

### Action Sequence:

#### 1. Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:

```python
pick_up_obj("potato", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the potato
put_down_obj("potato", "countertop") # putting down the potato on the countertop
pick_up_obj("salt", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the salt
put_down_obj("salt", "countertop") # putting down the salt on the countertop
pick_up_obj("oil", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the oil
put_down_obj("oil", "countertop") # putting down the oil on the countertop
pick_up_tool("knife", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the knife
put_down_tool("knife", "countertop") # putting down the knife on the countertop
pick_up_tool("spatula", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the spatula
put_down_tool("spatula", "countertop") # putting down the spatula on the countertop
clean("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # cleaning the pan
pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the pan
put_down_rec("pan", "countertop") # putting down the pan on the countertop
```

#### 2. Cooking process:

```python
slice("potato", "knife", "updated_onto.ttl") # slicing the potato using the knife
pour_contents("oil", "pan") # pouring oil into the pan
switch("stove", "updated_onto.ttl") # switching on the stove
fry("potato", "pan") # frying the sliced potato in the pan
stir_contents("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # occasionally stirring the contents in the pan
wait(t) # waiting for the potatoes to fry
```

#### 3. Plating and serving:

```python
put_down_obj("salt", "pan") # adding salt to the fried potatoes
pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the pan
put_down_rec("pan", "plate") # transferring the fried potatoes from the pan to the plate
```

This completes the task of preparing potato fries using the given ingredients and tools.
