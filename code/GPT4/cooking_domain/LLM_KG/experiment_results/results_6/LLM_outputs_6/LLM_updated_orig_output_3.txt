### Chain of Thought (COT):

#### 1. Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:

To prepare potato fries, I need to gather the necessary ingredients and tools: potato, oil, salt, spatula, knife, and pan. If the pan is not clean, I will clean it first.

#### 2. Cooking process:

I will slice the potato using the knife, pour oil into the pan, and heat the oil. Then, I'll add the sliced potatoes into the pan and fry them while occasionally stirring with the spatula.

#### 3. Plating and serving:

Once the potatoes are fried, I will add salt and then place the fried potatoes onto a plate.

### Action Sequence:

#### 1. Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:

```python
pick_up_obj("potato", "initial_onto.ttl") # picking up the potato
put_down_obj("potato", "countertop") # putting down the potato on the countertop
pick_up_tool("knife", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the knife
put_down_tool("knife", "countertop") # putting down the knife on the countertop
pick_up_tool("spatula", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the spatula
put_down_tool("spatula", "countertop") # putting down the spatula on the countertop
clean("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # cleaning the pan
pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the pan
put_down_rec("pan", "stove") # putting down the pan on the stove
```

#### 2. Cooking process:

```python
slice("potato", "knife", "updated_onto.ttl") # slicing the potato using the knife
pick_up_obj("oil", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the oil
pour_contents("oil", "pan") # pouring oil into the pan
switch("stove", "updated_onto.ttl") # switching on the stove
wait(t) # waiting for the oil to heat up
pick_up_obj("potato", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the sliced potato
put_down_obj("potato", "pan") # putting the sliced potato into the pan
fry("potato", "updated_onto.ttl") # frying the sliced potato in the pan
stir_contents("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # occasionally stirring the contents in the pan
wait(t) # waiting for the potatoes to fry
```

#### 3. Plating and serving:

```python
pick_up_obj("salt", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the salt
pour_contents("salt", "pan") # adding salt to the fried potatoes in the pan
pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the pan
put_down_rec("pan", "plate") # transferring the fried potatoes from the pan to the plate
```

This action sequence ensures that all provided ingredients (potato, oil, salt) are correctly used, and the oil and salt steps are corrected based on the user prompt.
