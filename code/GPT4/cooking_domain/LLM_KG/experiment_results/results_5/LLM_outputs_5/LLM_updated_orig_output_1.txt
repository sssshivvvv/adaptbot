COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

1. Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:

To prepare lime tea, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the pan, water, lime, tea, and a glass. The pan and the glass should be cleaned initially if they are not.

pick_up_rec("pan", "initial_onto.ttl") # picking up the pan
clean("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # cleaning the pan
put_down_rec("pan", "stove") # putting down the pan on the stove
pick_up_obj("water", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the water
put_down_obj("water", "countertop") # putting down the water on the countertop
pick_up_obj("lime", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the lime
put_down_obj("lime", "countertop") # putting down the lime on the countertop
pick_up_obj("tea", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the tea
put_down_obj("tea", "countertop") # putting down the tea on the countertop
clean("glass", "updated_onto.ttl") # cleaning the glass
pick_up_rec("glass", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the glass
put_down_rec("glass", "countertop") # putting down the glass on the countertop

2. Cooking process:

To prepare lime tea, I need to boil the water first and then add lime and tea.

pick_up_obj("water", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the water
put_down_obj("water", "pan") # putting down the water into the pan
boil("water", "updated_onto.ttl") # boiling the water

3. Plating and serving:

After boiling the water, I will pour the boiled water into the glass, add the tea into the glass, and finally slice the lime into the glass. I will stir the contents to complete the lime tea preparation.

pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the pan with boiled water
pour_contents("pan", "glass") # pouring boiled water from the pan into the glass
pick_up_obj("tea", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the tea
put_down_obj("tea", "glass") # putting the tea into the glass with boiled water
slice("lime", "knife", "updated_onto.ttl") # slicing the lime using the knife
put_down_obj("lime", "glass") # putting the sliced lime into the glass
stir_contents("glass", "updated_onto.ttl") # stirring the contents of the glass
