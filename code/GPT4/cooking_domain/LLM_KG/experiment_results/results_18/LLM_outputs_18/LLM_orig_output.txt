put_down_obj("butter", "countertop") # Putting down the butter on the countertop
pick_up_obj("sugar", "updated_onto.ttl") # Picking up the sugar
put_down_obj("sugar", "countertop") # Putting down the sugar on the countertop
pick_up_obj("milk", "updated_onto.ttl") # Picking up the milk
put_down_obj("milk", "countertop") # Putting down the milk on the countertop
pick_up_tool("spatula", "updated_onto.ttl") # Picking up the spatula
put_down_tool("spatula", "countertop") # Putting down the spatula on the countertop
pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # Picking up the pan
put_down_rec("pan", "stove") # Placing the pan on the stove
```

#### 2. Cooking process:

```plaintext
slice("carrot", "chefs_knife", "updated_onto.ttl") # Slicing the carrot
pick_up_obj("butter", "updated_onto.ttl") # Picking up the butter
put_down_obj("butter", "pan") # Putting butter into the pan
wait(1) # Waiting for the butter to melt
pick_up_obj("carrot", "updated_onto.ttl") # Picking up the sliced carrot
put_down_obj("carrot", "pan") # Adding sliced carrot into the pan
fry("carrot", "updated_onto.ttl") # Frying the carrot in butter
pick_up_obj("milk", "updated_onto.ttl") # Picking up the milk
pour_contents("milk", "pan") # Pouring milk into the pan
pick_up_obj("sugar", "updated_onto.ttl") # Picking up the sugar
put_down_obj("sugar", "pan") # Adding sugar into the pan
stir_contents("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # Stirring the contents of the pan
wait(5) # Waiting for the mixture to thicken
```

#### 3. Plating and serving:
