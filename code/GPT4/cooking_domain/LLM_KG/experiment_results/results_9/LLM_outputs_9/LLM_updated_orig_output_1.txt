Thank you for pointing out the issues. I'll revise the Chain of Thought (COT) and the action sequence accordingly. I'll ensure that all the provided ingredients are used and actions strictly follow the environment's constraints.

### Chain of Thought (COT) & Action Sequence:

1. **Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:**

To prepare mashed potatoes, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the potato, butter, and salt. Additionally, I will bring the tools needed: a pan for boiling the potatoes, a bowl for mashing, and a spoon for mixing. If any of the required receptacles or tools are not clean, I will clean them first.

```plaintext
pick_up_obj("potato", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the potato
put_down_obj("potato", "countertop") #putting down the potato on the countertop

pick_up_obj("butter", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the butter
put_down_obj("butter", "countertop") #putting down the butter on the countertop

pick_up_obj("salt", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the salt
put_down_obj("salt", "countertop") #putting down the salt on the countertop

pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the pan
put_down_rec("pan", "countertop") #putting down the pan on the countertop

pick_up_rec("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the bowl
put_down_rec("bowl", "countertop") #putting down the bowl on the countertop

pick_up_tool("spoon", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the spoon
put_down_tool("spoon", "countertop") #putting down the spoon on the countertop
```

2. **Cooking process:**

To prepare mashed potatoes, I need to boil the potatoes first. After boiling, I will mash them with butter and salt in a bowl.

```plaintext
boil("potato", "updated_onto.ttl") #boiling the potato 
```

3. **Plating and serving:**

I will transfer the boiled potato to a bowl and mash it with butter and salt using a spoon. The mashed potatoes will then be ready to serve.

```plaintext
pick_up_obj("potato", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the boiled potato
put_down_obj("potato", "bowl") #putting down the boiled potato in the bowl

pick_up_obj("butter", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the butter
put_down_obj("butter", "bowl") #putting down the butter in the bowl

pick_up_obj("salt", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the salt
put_down_obj("salt", "bowl") #putting down the salt in the bowl

mix_contents("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") #mixing the contents of the bowl with the spoon
```

This sequence of action ensures all the ingredients provided by the user are strictly utilized and adheres to the constraint and available actions in the environment.
