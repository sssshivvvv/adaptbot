I apologize for the oversight. Since "salt" is not listed as one of the objects in your environment, I'll exclude it from the action sequence. Instead, I'll focus on using the ingredients present and ensure that the execution strictly follows the provided constraints.

### Chain of Thought (COT) & Action Sequence:

1. **Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:**

To prepare mashed potatoes, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the potato and butter. Additionally, I will bring the tools needed: a pan for boiling the potatoes, a bowl for mashing, and a spoon for mixing. 

```plaintext
pick_up_obj("potato", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the potato
put_down_obj("potato", "countertop") #putting down the potato on the countertop

pick_up_obj("butter", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the butter
put_down_obj("butter", "countertop") #putting down the butter on the countertop

pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the pan
put_down_rec("pan", "countertop") #putting down the pan on the countertop

pick_up_rec("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the bowl
put_down_rec("bowl", "countertop") #putting down the bowl on the countertop

pick_up_tool("spoon", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the spoon
put_down_tool("spoon", "countertop") #putting down the spoon on the countertop
```

2. **Cooking process:**

To prepare mashed potatoes, I need to boil the potatoes first. After boiling, I will mash them with butter in a bowl.

```plaintext
boil("potato", "updated_onto.ttl") #boiling the potato 
```

3. **Plating and serving:**

I will transfer the boiled potato to a bowl and mash it with butter using a spoon. The mashed potatoes will then be ready to serve.

```plaintext
pick_up_obj("potato", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the boiled potato
put_down_obj("potato", "bowl") #putting down the boiled potato in the bowl

pick_up_obj("butter", "updated_onto.ttl") #picking up the butter
put_down_obj("butter", "bowl") #putting down the butter in the bowl

mix_contents("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") #mixing the contents of the bowl with the spoon
```

This revised action sequence ensures that only the ingredients listed in the environment are used and adheres to the constraints and available actions.
