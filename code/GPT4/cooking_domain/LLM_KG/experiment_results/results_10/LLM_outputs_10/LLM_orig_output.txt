Sure! Here is the chain of thought and action sequence to prepare a fruit salad using the minimum ingredients ['apple', 'mango']:

**COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:**

1. **Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:**

   To prepare the fruit salad, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the apple, mango, cutting_board, knife, and bowl. If the bowl is not cleaned, I will clean it first.

   ```python
   pick_up_obj("apple", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the apple
   put_down_obj("apple", "countertop") # putting down the apple on the countertop
   pick_up_obj("mango", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the mango
   put_down_obj("mango", "countertop") # putting down the mango on the countertop
   clean("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") # cleaning the bowl
   pick_up_rec("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the bowl
   put_down_rec("bowl", "countertop") # putting down the bowl on the countertop
   pick_up_tool("knife", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the knife
   put_down_tool("knife", "countertop") # putting down the knife on the countertop
   pick_up_rec("cutting_board", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the cutting board
   put_down_rec("cutting_board", "countertop") # putting down the cutting board on the countertop
   ```

2. **Cooking process:**

   To prepare the fruit salad, I will slice the apple and mango using the knife and cutting board. Then, I will mix the sliced fruit in the bowl.

   ```python
   slice("apple", "knife", "updated_onto.ttl") # slicing the apple on the cutting board
   slice("mango", "knife", "updated_onto.ttl") # slicing the mango on the cutting board
   pick_up_obj("apple", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the sliced apple
   put_down_obj("apple", "bowl") # putting the sliced apple into the bowl
   pick_up_obj("mango", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the sliced mango
   put_down_obj("mango", "bowl") # putting the sliced mango into the bowl
   ```

3. **Plating and serving:**

   The fruit salad is ready to be served. I will serve the fruit salad by putting it into a bowl.

   ```python
   mix_contents("bowl", "updated_onto.ttl") # mixing the contents of the bowl
   ```

This completes the preparation of the fruit salad using apple and mango.
