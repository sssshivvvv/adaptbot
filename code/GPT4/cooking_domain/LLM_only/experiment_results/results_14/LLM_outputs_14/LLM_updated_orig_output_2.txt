            **COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:**

### 1. Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task

To prepare the egg sandwich, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the bread, egg, and butter. I will also need a pan, a spatula, and a plate for plating. If the plate is not cleaned, I will clean it first.

1. `pick_up_obj("bread", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the bread
2. `put_down_obj("bread", "countertop")` # putting down the bread on the countertop
3. `pick_up_obj("egg", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the egg
4. `put_down_obj("egg", "countertop")` # putting down the egg on the countertop
5. `pick_up_obj("butter", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the butter
6. `put_down_obj("butter", "countertop")` # putting down the butter on the countertop
7. `pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the pan
8. `put_down_rec("pan", "stove")` # putting down the pan on the stove
9. `pick_up_tool("spatula", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the spatula
10. `put_down_tool("spatula", "countertop")` # putting down the spatula on the countertop
11. `clean("plate", "updated_onto.ttl")` # cleaning the plate
12. `pick_up_rec("plate", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the plate
13. `put_down_rec("plate", "countertop")` # putting down the plate on the countertop

### 2. Cooking process

To prepare the egg sandwich, I will cook the egg in the pan, lightly toast the bread using the butter, and then assemble the sandwich.

14. `pick_up_obj("butter", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the butter
15. `put_down_obj("butter", "pan")` # placing the butter in the pan
16. `switch("stove", "updated_onto.ttl")` # turning on the stove
17. `wait(t)` # allowing the butter to melt in the pan
18. `pick_up_obj("egg", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the egg
19. `put_down_obj("egg", "pan")` # cracking the egg in the pan
20. `wait(t)` # cooking the egg in the pan
21. `pick_up_obj("bread", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the bread
22. `put_down_obj("bread", "pan")` # placing the bread in the pan to lightly toast
23. `wait(t)` # toasting the bread

### 3. Plating and serving

Once the egg is cooked and the bread is lightly toasted, I will assemble the egg sandwich on the plate and serve it.

24. `pick_up_obj("bread", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the toasted bread from the pan
25. `put_down_obj("bread", "plate")` # placing the bread on the plate
26. `pick_up_obj("egg", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the cooked egg from the pan
27. `put_down_obj("egg", "bread")` # placing the egg on the bread on the plate
28. `pick_up_obj("bread", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the second slice of bread (if sandwich needs two slices)
29. `put_down_obj("bread", "egg")` # placing the second slice of bread on top of the egg to complete the sandwich

The egg sandwich is ready!
