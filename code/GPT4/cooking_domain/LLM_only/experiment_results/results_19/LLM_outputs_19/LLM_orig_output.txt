Sure! Here is the chain of thought (COT) and the action sequence to prepare banana chips with the minimum ingredients ['banana', 'oil', 'salt'].

### Chain of Thought (COT) & Action Sequence:

**1. Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:**

For preparing banana chips, I will first fetch the necessary items. I will need a banana, oil, salt, a knife, a cutting board, a pan, and a plate. If the plate or pan are not cleaned, I will clean them first.

1. `pick_up_obj("banana", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the banana
2. `put_down_obj("banana", "countertop")` # putting down the banana on the countertop
3. `pick_up_obj("oil", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the oil
4. `put_down_obj("oil", "countertop")` # putting down the oil on the countertop
5. `pick_up_obj("salt", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the salt
6. `put_down_obj("salt", "countertop")` # putting down the salt on the countertop
7. `pick_up_tool("knife", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the knife
8. `put_down_tool("knife", "countertop")` # putting down the knife on the countertop
9. `pick_up_rec("cutting_board", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the cutting_board
10. `put_down_rec("cutting_board", "countertop")` # putting down the cutting_board on the countertop
11. `clean("pan", "updated_onto.ttl")` # cleaning the pan
12. `pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the pan
13. `put_down_rec("pan", "countertop")` # putting down the pan on the countertop
14. `clean("plate", "updated_onto.ttl")` # cleaning the plate
15. `pick_up_rec("plate", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the plate
16. `put_down_rec("plate", "countertop")` # putting down the plate on the countertop 

**2. Cooking process:**

To prepare banana chips, I will slice the banana, then I will fry the banana slices in the pan with oil. 

17. `slice("banana", "knife", "countertop")` # slicing the banana with the knife on the countertop
18. `fry("banana", "updated_onto.ttl")` # frying the banana slices in the pan  

**3. Plating and serving:**

I will put the fried banana slices onto the plate. I will then sprinkle some salt on the banana chips. The banana chips are ready!

19. `pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl")` # picking up the pan
20. `pour_contents("pan", "plate")` # pouring the fried banana slices onto the plate
21. `sprinkle("salt", "plate", "updated_onto.ttl")` # sprinkling salt on the fried banana slices

That's the chain of thought and the action sequence to prepare banana chips.
