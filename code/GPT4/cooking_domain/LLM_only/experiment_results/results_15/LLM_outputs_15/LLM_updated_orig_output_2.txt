I apologize for the oversight. Given the constraint that the blender cannot be picked up, we will adjust the action sequence accordingly.

### Chain of Thought and Action Sequence for Apple Smoothie:

#### 1. Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:

To prepare the apple smoothie, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the apple, milk, knife, and find a suitable location to use the blender. If the blender and glass are not clean, I will clean them first.

#### Actions:
```plaintext
pick_up_obj("apple", "initial_onto.ttl") # picking up the apple
put_down_obj("apple", "countertop") # putting down the apple on the countertop
pick_up_obj("milk", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the milk
put_down_obj("milk", "countertop") # putting down the milk on the countertop
pick_up_tool("knife", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the knife
put_down_tool("knife", "countertop") # putting down the knife on the countertop
clean("blender", "updated_onto.ttl") # cleaning the blender if dirty
clean("glass", "updated_onto.ttl") # cleaning the glass if dirty
```

#### 2. Cooking process:

To prepare the apple smoothie, the apple should be sliced and all ingredients should be added to the blender.

#### Actions:
```plaintext
pick_up_obj("apple", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the apple
slice("apple", "knife", "updated_onto.ttl") # slicing the apple
put_down_obj("apple", "countertop") # putting down the sliced apple
pick_up_obj("apple", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the sliced apple
put_down_obj("apple", "blender") # putting down the sliced apple in the blender
pick_up_obj("milk", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the milk
put_down_obj("milk", "blender") # putting down the milk in the blender
pick_up_obj("sugar", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the sugar
put_down_obj("sugar", "blender") # putting down the sugar in the blender
mix_contents("blender", "updated_onto.ttl") # blending the contents together
```

#### 3. Plating and serving:

After blending, I will pour the apple smoothie into the glass and serve it.

#### Actions:
```plaintext
pour_contents("blender", "glass") # pouring the contents into a glass
```

This should be the corrected chain of thought and action sequence for preparing an apple smoothie using all the specified ingredients.
