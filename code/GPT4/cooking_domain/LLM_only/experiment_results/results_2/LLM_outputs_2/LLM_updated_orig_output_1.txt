**COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:**

1. **Fetching the ingredients and tools required for the cooking task:**

To prepare the coffee, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the milk, water, coffee, a glass, and a pan. If the glass is not cleaned, I will clean it first.

```plaintext
pick_up_obj("milk", "initial_onto.ttl") # picking up the milk
put_down_obj("milk", "countertop") # putting down the milk on the countertop
pick_up_obj("water", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the water
put_down_obj("water", "countertop") # putting down the water on the countertop
pick_up_obj("coffee", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the coffee
put_down_obj("coffee", "countertop") # putting down the coffee on the countertop
pick_up_rec("glass", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the glass
clean("glass", "updated_onto.ttl") # cleaning the glass
put_down_rec("glass", "countertop") # putting down the glass on the countertop
pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the pan
put_down_rec("pan", "countertop") # putting down the pan on the countertop
```

2. **Cooking process:**

To prepare the coffee, both water and milk should be boiled together, so I will boil them in the pan.

```plaintext
pick_up_obj("milk", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the milk
pour_contents("milk", "pan") # pouring the milk into the pan
pick_up_obj("water", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the water
pour_contents("water", "pan") # pouring the water into the pan
boil("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # boiling the milk and water mixture for the coffee
```

3. **Plating and serving:**

I will put the boiled mixture of milk and water into the glass, then I will put the coffee into the glass. I will stir the contents. The coffee is ready!

```plaintext
pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the pan
pour_contents("pan", "glass") # pouring the boiled mixture into the glass
pick_up_obj("coffee", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the coffee
put_down_obj("coffee", "glass") # putting the coffee into the glass filled with the boiled mixture
stir_contents("glass", "updated_onto.ttl") # stirring the contents of the glass
```

This concludes the task sequence to prepare coffee using the provided ingredients.
