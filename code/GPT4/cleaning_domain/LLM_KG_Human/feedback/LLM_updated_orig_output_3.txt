Understood. I apologize for the mistake. It looks like I incorrectly referred to "mop_cloth" as a tool instead of an object. Let's correct that.

COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

To clean the bedroom floor, I will first ensure I have the mop cloth. I will move to the bedroom, then use the mop cloth to clean the floor there. After cleaning, I will put the mop cloth back in an appropriate location.

1. move("bedroom", "initial_onto.ttl") # moving to the bedroom
2. pick_up_obj("mop_cloth", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the mop cloth
3. mop("bedroom_floor", "updated_onto.ttl") # mopping the bedroom floor
4. put_down_obj("mop_cloth", "rack") # putting down the mop cloth on the rack
