Sure! Let's break down the process to play music using the 'music_player' in the environment.

### Chain of Thought (COT):
To play music, the robot will first move to the appropriate location where the music player is situated (assuming we need it for interaction). Then, the robot will pick up the music player if needed and place it in the desired location to operate it. Finally, the robot will switch on the music player. If the music player is already in the desired location, the robot will directly switch it on.

### Action Sequence:

1. **Locate the Music Player:**
   - The robot should know the location of the music player to move there.

2. **Move to the Music Player's Location:**
   - The robot will navigate to the specified room where the music player is located.

3. **Pick up the Music Player:**
   - If the music player is not in the desired location, the robot will pick it up to move it to the appropriate location (e.g., living room for better acoustics).

4. **Put Down the Music Player:**
   - The robot will place the music player in the desired location (if needed).

5. **Switch on the Music Player:**
   - The robot will then switch on the music player to start playing the music.

### Actions:

```python
# Example assuming the music player starts in the bedroom and needs to be moved to the living room

move("bedroom", "initial_onto.ttl") # moving to the bedroom where music player is located
pick_up_rec("music_player", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the music player
move("living_room", "updated_onto.ttl") # moving to the living room
put_down_rec("music_player", "living_room") # placing the music player in the living room
switch("music_player", "updated_onto.ttl") # switching on the music player to play music
```

In this sequence, the robot first moves to the bedroom where the music player is located, picks it up, moves to the living room, places it down, and then switches it on to play music.
