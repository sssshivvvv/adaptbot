COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

To charge the phone, I will first locate the charging pod. Then, I will move the charging pod to a suitable location if needed. Since these are the minimum items specified, I will concentrate on using them efficiently without involving any irrelevant objects. I will switch on the charging pod to ensure it can charge the phone. Finally, I will place the phone on the charging pod to start charging.
