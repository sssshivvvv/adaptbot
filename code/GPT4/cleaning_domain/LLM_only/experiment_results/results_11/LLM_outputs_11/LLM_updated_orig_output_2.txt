### Chain of Thought (COT):
To play the music, the robot will first move to the location where the music player is situated. Next, it will switch the music player on. Considering that the music player is too big for the robot to move, it will not attempt to reposition it and will instead operate it in its current location.

### Action Sequence:
1. **Move to Music Player's Location**:
    - Determine the initial location (assume the music player is in the living room).

2. **Switch on the Music Player**:
    - Switch on the music player to start playing the music.

### Actions:

```python
move("living_room", "initial_onto.ttl")  # move to the living room where the music player is located
switch("music_player", "updated_onto.ttl")  # switch on the music player to play music
```

In this sequence, the robot moves to the living room where the music player is already situated and switches it on to play music. The task is completed using only the relevant items specified in the prompt.
