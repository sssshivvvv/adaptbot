To mop the countertop, I will need to use the mop_cloth. Since mop_cloth was mentioned but not listed in the given tools, I will assume it's an available object. Here's the corrected COT and action sequence strictly following the action descriptions provided:

COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

To mop the countertop, I will:
1. Fetch the cleaning_solution.

pick_up_obj("cleaning_solution", "initial_onto.ttl") # picking up the cleaning solution
