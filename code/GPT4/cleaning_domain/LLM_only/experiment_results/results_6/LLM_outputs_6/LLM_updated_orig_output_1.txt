### Chain of Thought (COT):
To clean the window, I will need the mop_cloth and cleaning_solution. I will first move to the washroom where the mop_cloth is located, then pick up the mop_cloth. I will go to the kitchen to pick up the cleaning_solution. Finally, I will clean the window with the mop_cloth and cleaning_solution.

### Action Sequence:
```python
move("washroom", "initial_onto.ttl") # moving to the washroom
pick_up_tool("mop_cloth", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the mop_cloth
move("kitchen", "updated_onto.ttl") # moving to the kitchen
pick_up_obj("cleaning_solution", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the cleaning_solution
move("living_room", "updated_onto.ttl") # moving to the living room to clean the window
mop("window", "updated_onto.ttl") # cleaning the window with the mop_cloth and cleaning_solution
put_down_tool("mop_cloth", "washroom") # putting down the mop_cloth back to washroom
put_down_obj("cleaning_solution", "kitchen") # putting back the cleaning_solution in the kitchen
```
