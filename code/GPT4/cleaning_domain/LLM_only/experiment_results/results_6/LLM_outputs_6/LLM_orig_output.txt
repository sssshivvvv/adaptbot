Sure, let's focus on cleaning the window using the minimum items involved:

### Chain of Thought (COT):
To clean the window, I will need the mop and cleaning_solution. I will first move to the washroom where the mop is located, then pick up the mop. I will go to the kitchen to pick up the cleaning_solution. Finally, I will clean the window with the mop and cleaning_solution.

### Action Sequence:
```python
move("washing_machine", "initial_onto.ttl") # moving to the washroom
pick_up_tool("mop", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the mop
move("fridge", "updated_onto.ttl") # moving to the kitchen
pick_up_obj("cleaning_solution", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the cleaning_solution
move("window", "updated_onto.ttl") # moving to the living room to clean the window
mop("window", "updated_onto.ttl") # cleaning the window with the mop and cleaning_solution
put_down_tool("mop", "washroom") # putting down the mop back to washroom
put_down_obj("cleaning_solution", "kitchen") # putting back the cleaning_solution in the kitchen
```
