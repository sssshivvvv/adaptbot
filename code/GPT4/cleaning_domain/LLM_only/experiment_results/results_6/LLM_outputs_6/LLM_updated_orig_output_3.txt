### Chain of Thought (COT):
To clean the window, I will need the mop_cloth and cleaning_solution. I will first fetch the mop_cloth and the cleaning_solution from their respective locations. I will then use these items to clean the window to ensure it is spotless. Finally, I will return the mop_cloth and the cleaning_solution to their original places.

### Action Sequence:
```python
pick_up_tool("mop_cloth", "initial_onto.ttl") # picking up the mop_cloth
pick_up_obj("cleaning_solution", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the cleaning_solution
mop("window", "updated_onto.ttl") # cleaning the window with the mop_cloth and cleaning_solution
put_down_tool("mop_cloth", "updated_onto.ttl") # putting down the mop_cloth back at its location
put_down_obj("cleaning_solution", "updated_onto.ttl") # putting back the cleaning_solution at its location
```
