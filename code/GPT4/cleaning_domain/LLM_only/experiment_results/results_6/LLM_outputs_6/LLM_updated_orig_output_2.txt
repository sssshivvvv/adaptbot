### Chain of Thought (COT):
To clean the window, I will need the mop_cloth and cleaning_solution. I will first fetch the mop_cloth from its location. Then, I will fetch the cleaning_solution. I will clean the window with the mop_cloth and cleaning_solution to ensure it is spotless.

### Action Sequence:
```python
pick_up_tool("mop_cloth", "initial_onto.ttl") # picking up the mop_cloth
pick_up_obj("cleaning_solution", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the cleaning_solution
mop("window", "updated_onto.ttl") # cleaning the window with the mop_cloth and cleaning_solution
put_down_tool("mop_cloth", "washroom") # putting down the mop_cloth back in the washroom
put_down_obj("cleaning_solution", "kitchen") # putting back the cleaning_solution in the kitchen
```
