COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

To clean the bedroom floor, I need a mop cloth. I will pick up the mop cloth first. Then, I will move to the bedroom, and use the mop cloth to clean the floor there. After cleaning, I will put the mop cloth back to its place.

1. pick_up_tool("mop_cloth", "initial_onto.ttl") # picking up the mop cloth
2. move("bedroom", "updated_onto.ttl") # moving to the bedroom
