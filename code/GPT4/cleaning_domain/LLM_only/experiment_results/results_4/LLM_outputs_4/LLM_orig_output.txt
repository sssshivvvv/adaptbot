Chain of Thought: To water the plants, I will first fetch the water. I will then bring the plant if it is not already accessible. Finally, I will use the water to hydrate the plant.

COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

1. Fetch the water.
2. Fetch the plant (if accessible).
3. Water the plant.

Action Sequence:

1. pick_up_obj("water", "initial_onto.ttl") # Picking up the water
2. put_down_obj("water", "plant") # Watering the plant by putting down the water on it
