Thank you for pointing out the error. Indeed, the provided environment details did not explicitly include "detergent" as an object. Let's address this oversight and generate the task sequence again using items strictly present in the environment.

In this revised task sequence, we will only use items specified in the given environment.

**Chain of Thought:**

To wash the clothes, I will first fetch the clothes and take them to the washing machine. Since no detergent is explicitly given in the environment, I will proceed with washing the clothes using the washing machine only. I will place the clothes into the washing machine and then switch on the washing machine to start the washing process. Once the washing machine has finished washing, the task is complete.

**Action Sequence:**

pick_up_obj("clothes", "initial_onto.ttl") # picking up the clothes
put_down_obj("clothes", "washing_machine") # putting the clothes into the washing machine
switch("washing_machine", "updated_onto.ttl") # switching on the washing machine

That's the updated action sequence for washing clothes using the available items in the environment.
