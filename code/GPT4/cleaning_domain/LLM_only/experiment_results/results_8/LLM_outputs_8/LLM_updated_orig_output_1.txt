### Chain of Thought (COT):

To clean the table, I need to fetch the mop cloth, which is the primary item required for this task. Then, I will use the mop cloth to clean the table.

### Action Sequence:

1. **Fetch the mop cloth**
2. **Use the mop cloth to clean the table**

### Actions:

1. `pick_up_obj("mop_cloth", "initial_onto.ttl")` # Picking up the mop cloth
2. `put_down_obj("mop_cloth", "table")` # Placing the mop cloth on the table to clean it
3. `clean("table", "updated_onto.ttl")` # Using the mop cloth to clean the table

This sequence ensures that the explicit requirement to use the mop cloth is met while performing the task of cleaning the table.
