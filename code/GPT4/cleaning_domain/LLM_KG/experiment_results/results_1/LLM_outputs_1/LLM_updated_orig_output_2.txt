Thank you for the clarification. I understand now that "mop_cloth" must be used even if it wasn't explicitly listed in the initial environment. I will treat it as an implied addition for this task. Let's redo this correctly.

COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

To dust the TV, I will use a mop_cloth. The action involves going to the living room (assuming the TV is located there), picking up the mop_cloth, using it to dust the TV, and then returning the mop_cloth to its place.

First, I will move to the living room. Then, I will pick up the mop_cloth, dust the TV, and finally put down the mop_cloth back in its place.

move("living_room", "initial_onto.ttl") # Moving to the living room
pick_up_obj("mop_cloth", "updated_onto.ttl") # Picking up the mop_cloth
clean("TV", "updated_onto.ttl") # Dusting the TV with the mop_cloth
put_down_obj("mop_cloth", "living_room") # Placing the mop_cloth back in the living room
