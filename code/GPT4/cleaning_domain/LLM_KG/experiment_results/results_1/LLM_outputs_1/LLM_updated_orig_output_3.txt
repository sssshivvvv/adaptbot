            I apologize for the oversight. Let's ensure that we are using the given items strictly as per your prompt and the environment details.

Since "TV" was not provided in the items, I'll need to either assume a generic "item" or realize it's not explicitly listed. I'll proceed with dusting a generic "item" with the provided "mop_cloth".

COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

To effectively dust an item using the mop_cloth, I will first locate the mop_cloth, pick it up, use it to dust the item, and finally put it back in its place. I'll assume the item to be dusted is in the living_room.

1. Move to the living_room where the item is located.
2. Pick up the mop_cloth.
3. Use the mop_cloth to dust the item.
4. Return the mop_cloth to a designated place in the living_room.

move("living_room", "initial_onto.ttl") # Moving to the living room
pick_up_obj("mop_cloth", "updated_onto.ttl") # Picking up the mop_cloth
clean("item", "updated_onto.ttl") # Dusting the item with the mop_cloth
put_down_obj("mop_cloth", "living_room_floor") # Placing the mop_cloth back in the living room
