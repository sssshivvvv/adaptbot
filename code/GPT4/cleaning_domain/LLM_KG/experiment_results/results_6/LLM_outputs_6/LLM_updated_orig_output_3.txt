### Chain of Thought (COT):
To clean the window, I need to use the minimum items specified: the mop_cloth and the cleaning_solution. The process will involve fetching these items and then cleaning the window with them.

### Action Sequence:
```python
pick_up_obj("cleaning_solution", "initial_onto.ttl") # picking up the cleaning_solution
put_down_obj("cleaning_solution", "living_room_floor") # putting down the cleaning_solution near the window
pick_up_rec("cloth", "initial_onto.ttl") # picking up the mop_cloth (considered as a receptacle)
put_down_rec("cloth", "living_room_floor") # putting down the mop_cloth near the window
clean("window", "updated_onto.ttl") # cleaning the window with the cleaning_solution and mop_cloth
```
