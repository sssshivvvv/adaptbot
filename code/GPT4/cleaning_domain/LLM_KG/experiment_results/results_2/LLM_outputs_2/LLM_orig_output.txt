Sure, let's generate the chain of thought and action sequence for washing clothes while using the minimum items necessary.

**Chain of Thought:**

To wash the clothes, I will first fetch the items I need. I will bring the clothes and detergent to the washing machine. Since washing involves putting the clothes and detergent into the washing machine, those are the minimum items required. I will put the clothes and detergent into the washing machine, and then switch on the washing machine to start the washing process. Once the washing machine has finished washing, the task is complete.

**Action Sequence:**

pick_up_obj("clothes", "initial_onto.ttl") # picking up the clothes
put_down_obj("clothes", "washing_machine") # putting the clothes into the washing machine
pick_up_obj("detergent", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the detergent
put_down_obj("detergent", "washing_machine") # putting the detergent into the washing machine
switch("washing_machine", "updated_onto.ttl") # switching on the washing machine

That's the complete action sequence for washing clothes using the items suggested.
