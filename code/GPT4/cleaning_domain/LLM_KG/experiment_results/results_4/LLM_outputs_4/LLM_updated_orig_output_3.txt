Understood, thank you for pointing that out. I apologize for the oversight. Here is the revised Chain of Thought and Action Sequence to correctly use the ingredients as specified:

**Chain of Thought:**

To wash the clothes, I will first need to gather the clothes. Next, I will place the clothes into the washing machine. The detergent is necessary for cleaning the clothes, so I will also ensure the addition of detergent to the washing machine before starting the wash cycle. Finally, I will switch on the washing machine to begin the washing process.

**Action Sequence:**

pick_up_obj("clothes", "initial_onto.ttl") # picking up the clothes
put_down_obj("clothes", "washing_machine") # putting the clothes into the washing machine
pick_up_obj("detergent", "updated_onto.ttl") # picking up the detergent
put_down_obj("detergent", "washing_machine") # adding the detergent to the washing machine
switch("washing_machine", "updated_onto.ttl") # switching on the washing machine

This sequence strictly uses the provided items ('clothes', 'detergent', and 'washing_machine') and follows the necessary steps to complete the task.
