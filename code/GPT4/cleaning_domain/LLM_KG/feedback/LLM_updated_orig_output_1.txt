I apologize for the oversight. Let me correct that:

### COT & ACTION SEQUENCE:

To charge the phone, I should use the charging_pod. Since the environment description listed doesn't include a phone, we will use the robot_arm to handle the charging_pod. I will move the charging_pod to a location where it can charge effectively. Then, I will ensure the charging pod is switched on so that it's ready to charge the phone.

pick_up_rec("charging_pod", "initial_onto.ttl")  # picking up the charging pod
put_down_rec("charging_pod", "table")  # placing the charging pod on the table
switch("charging_pod", "updated_onto.ttl")  # switching on the charging pod for charging

This task sequence ensures that all actions pertain directly to the charging task, involving the charging_pod as provided in the description.
