put_down_obj("pan", "countertop")  #putting down the pan on the countertop
pick_up_obj("eggs", "updated_onto.ttl")  #picking up the eggs
put_down_obj("eggs", "countertop")  #putting down the eggs on the countertop
pick_up_obj("onion", "updated_onto.ttl")  #picking up the onion 
put_down_obj("onion", "countertop")  #putting down the onion on the countertop
pick_up_obj("tomato", "updated_onto.ttl")  #picking up the tomato 
put_down_obj("tomato", "countertop")  #putting down the tomato on the countertop
pick_up_obj("salt", "updated_onto.ttl")  #picking up the salt 
put_down_obj("salt", "countertop")  #putting down the salt on the countertop
pick_up_obj("pepper", "updated_onto.ttl")  #picking up the pepper 
put_down_obj("pepper", "countertop")  #putting down the pepper on the countertop
clean("pan", "updated_onto.ttl")  #cleaning the pan
pick_up_rec("pan", "updated_onto.ttl")  #picking up the pan

pick_up_tool("spatula", "updated_onto.ttl")  #picking up the spatula
put_down_tool("spatula", "countertop")  #putting down the spatula on the countertop

2. Cooking process:

To prepare the omelette, I will crack the eggs into the pan, add chopped onion and tomato, season with salt and pepper, and cook the mixture.

pick_up_obj("eggs", "updated_onto.ttl")  #picking up the eggs
put_down_obj("eggs", "pan")  #putting down the eggs into the pan
pick_up_obj("onion", "updated_onto.ttl")  #picking up the onion 
put_down_obj("onion", "pan")  #putting down the chopped onion into the pan
pick_up_obj("tomato", "updated_onto.ttl")  #picking up the tomato 
put_down_obj("tomato", "pan")  #putting down the chopped tomato into the pan
pick_up_obj("salt", "updated_onto.ttl")  #picking up the salt 
put_down_obj("salt", "pan")  #putting down the salt into the pan
pick_up_obj("pepper", "updated_onto.ttl")  #picking up the pepper 
put_down_obj("pepper", "pan")  #putting down the pepper into the pan
fry("egg", "updated_onto.ttl")  #cooking the omelette mixture

3. Plating and serving:

I will use the spatula to flip the omelette, cook it on the other side, and then transfer it to a plate. The omelette is ready to be served!

flip("omelette", "updated_onto.ttl")  #flipping the omelette
fry("egg", "updated_onto.ttl")  #cooking the other side of the omelette
